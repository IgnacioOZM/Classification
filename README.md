# Classification
This GitHub repository will track all of my projects regarding classification for my machine learning course.
Classification is a process of categorizing a given set of data into classes; it can be performed on both 
structured and unstructured data. The process starts with predicting the class of given data points. 
The classes are often referred to as target, label or categories.

In this course I will focus on the classification of structured data with the implementation of multiple algorithms:
* Logarithmic regression (LogReg)
* K Nearest Neighbor (KNN)
* Support Vector Machines (SVM)
* Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP)
